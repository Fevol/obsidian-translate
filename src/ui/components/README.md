A _tiny_ Svelte component library specifically written for usage in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugins.
This is just a refactor of the components I use in the [Obsidian Translate](https://github.com/Fevol/obsidian-translate) plugin,
so I have one unified library to use in all my plugins.

Feel free to use this library, but keep in mind that you will have to tweak things to fit your own use-cases.

Don't forget to import the styles from the library in your SCSS entrypoint.
